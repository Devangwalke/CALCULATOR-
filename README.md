# CALCULATOR-


This project involves the design and development of a basic calculator application that performs fundamental arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The objective is to understand and implement user interface design, event handling, and logic building in a programming environment.

The calculator takes numerical input from users through buttons, processes the desired operation, and displays the result in real-time. The project helps reinforce core programming concepts such as variables, conditionals, functions, and loops.

The calculator can be implemented using languages such as Python (Tkinter), Java (Swing), or web technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, depending on the platform and learning objectives.
